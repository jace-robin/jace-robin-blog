                <h1>Creating an Account</h1>
                <p>The first step to creating account is visiting<a style="color: blue" href="https://github.com"> github </a>(click github to be redirected)</p>
                <p>Click Sign Up in the top right corner, and fill out the information</p>
                <p>Once done, you are ready to move on to the next step!</p>
                <br>
                <h1>Creating a Repository</h1>
                <p>A repository is like a folder on your computer. It hosts your code online, and allows you to use 'git' command line commands, which will be used later on in this tutorial</p>
                <p>To start, click your account in the top left after signing in, and click "Your Profile"</p>
                <p>This is your personal page, where people can visit and view your code. Next, click "Repositories", located near the top of your screen</p>
                <p>Click the green button that says New</p>
                <br>
                <p>Now, think of a name for your new repository. This can be anything you wish</p>
                <p>However, if you intend to host a site, I would advise making this the same as your github username, and adding '.github.io' to the end of your repository name</p>
                <p>For example, if you chose the name 'john-doe', you would name the new repo(repository) john-doe.github.io</p>
                <p>Through github, you can host one page per account, and the default url ends in '.github.io'. You can buy a custom URL if you wish, but for people like me who are just having fun coding, it is far from neccessary</p>
                <p>Next, you may add a description. Though not neccesary, it can be useful to tell others what the repo is for</p>
                <p>Finally, click the green button labeled Create Repository</p>
                <br>
                <h1>Your New Repo</h1>
                <p>If you completed the last step, you should now have a new Repo! Right now, its pretty much empty, unless you added the optional README or a description</p>
                <p>For now, you are done here! Next, move to Setup Gitpod, where you will setup an online IDE, or integrated development environment</p>
